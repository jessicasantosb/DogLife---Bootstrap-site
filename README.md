# bootstrap site
First step learning Bootstrap.
My main motivation to do this project was for learn a new framework.
It's a site created with HTML and styled using Bootstrap.

What I learned:
<ul>
  <li>customizing colors, positions and sizes</li>
  <li>changing layout</li>
  <li>changing typography</li>
  <li>adding components like:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>buttons, cards, carousel, navbar, collapse and dropdowns</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  Live version of the site is <a href="https://jessicasantosb.github.io/DogLife---Bootstrap-site/">here</a>.
